# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains demographic and travel details of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic.

**Key Features:**
- Pclass – Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Sex – Passenger gender
- Age – Passenger age
- SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch – Number of parents/children aboard
- Fare – Ticket price
- Embarked – Port of embarkation
- Survived – Target variable (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- First-class passengers survived more than lower classes
- Younger passengers showed better survival chances
- Small family sizes improved survival probability
- Higher fares correlated positively with survival

---

## 🧠 Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values in Age and Embarked
- Encoded categorical variables
- Created family-based features
- Scaled numerical features
- Split data into training and testing sets

---

## 🤖 Model Building

- Logistic Regression used for binary classification
- Simple, interpretable, and effective for baseline modeling

---

## 📈 Results

- Achieved reliable classification accuracy
- Identified key factors influencing survival outcomes

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
